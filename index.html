                     <p>....to President of the United States (on my first try). I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius....and a very stable genius at that!</p>
                     <p>I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist. Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!</p>
                     <p>With all of the failed “experts” weighing in, does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn’t firm, strong and willing to commit our total “might” against the North. Fools, but talks are a good thing!</p>
                     <p>North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button works!</p>

                     <p>Since the first day I took office, all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election, Russia, Russia,Russia.  Despite this I have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month President. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!</p>

They should try winning an election. Sad!</p>
                     <p>Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents.

You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.”</p>
                     <p>How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin’ James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife’s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?</p>
                     <p>Many people in our Country are asking what the “Justice” Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and “acid washed” 33,000 Emails? No justice!</p>

                     <p>Bernie Sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the Dem primary by Crooked Hillary!</p>
                     <p>Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI &amp; Justice Dept.</p>
                     <p>The real story on Collusion is in Donna B&#39;s new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC &amp; then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!</p>
                     <p>Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn&#39;t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary &amp; the Dems..</p>
                     <p>Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren&#39;t Crooked Hillary &amp; the Dems the focus?????</p>

NOW WE KNOW! https://t.co/SgWL1HZmkI</p>
                     <p>Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side, not mine!</p>
                     <p>As it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!</p>
                     <p>Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating  Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many..</p>
                     <p>I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020? My answer was, &quot;I hope so!&quot;</p>
                     <p>The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media &quot;screaming&quot; for Crooked Hillary Clinton. Next, she was a bad candidate!</p>
                     <p>The Russia hoax continues, now it&#39;s ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?</p>
                     <p>After allowing North Korea to research and build Nukes while Secretary of State (Bill C also), Crooked Hillary now criticizes.</p>

                     <p>Wow, looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over...and so much more. A rigged system!</p>

                     <p>Problem is that the acting head of the FBI &amp; the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!</p>
                     <p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails &amp; DNC server) &amp; Intel leakers!</p>
                     <p>So why aren&#39;t the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes &amp; Russia relations?</p>
                     <p>My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media &amp; authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (&amp; acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails!</p>
                     <p>So many people are asking why isn&#39;t the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?</p>
                     <p>HillaryClinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate &amp; delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?</p>
                     <p>Why aren&#39;t the same standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!</p>
                     <p>...and did not want to &quot;rock the boat.&quot; He didn&#39;t &quot;choke,&quot; he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.</p>
                     <p>Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!</p>
                     <p>Obama Administration official said they &quot;choked&quot; when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn&#39;t want to hurt Hillary?</p>
                     <p>Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my non-dealings are?</p>
                     <p>A.G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposes...gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection. Totally illegal!</p>

                     <p>Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!</p>
